    <h3>Any cloud, anytime.</h3>
    <p>
        With Polaroid Cloud, you can sync your photos to your favorite cloud service while still enjoying the instant 
        printing you’ve come to expect from Polaroid. Using our special instant photo paper, your image is uploaded 
        to the web and a QR code is generated and printed with the instant photo. Perfect for sharing with your 
        friends and family.

    <h3>Easy, cheesy!</h3>
